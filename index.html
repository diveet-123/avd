    1)The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application
     by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.
    <br>
    <br>
    2)A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output
    and the keyboard is used for input. ... Modern consoles often provide a graphical interface that can be used to control machines
    on a local network (LAN) or provide remote access to remote systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    3)You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for
     code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and
      select Inspect, and then click Console.
